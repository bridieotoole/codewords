# Hunting and Gathering - Modular Typeface 
## Week 02

Today in class, we opened the day by huntering and gathering examples of moldular typefaces and showing these off in a [*Google Slide*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N2hAFp6si7UsVuPj1oMQ21_HHF858NbXZna0YQxOQio/edit#slide=id.p).

Some of the found letterforms included epic, generative brutalist styles from Tais Ghelli, to contemporary and simplified forms from Ahn Sang Soo Mano and Logan Dufrn.

While it wasn't necessary to have a digitally created typeface, the artist I selected is a linoleum artist. [*Leonie Staman*](https://www.detoffetoko.nl/leonie-staman) 3D prints her alphabet and manually traces these to create type inspired by the Spirograph techique most children will remember recieving as gifts from the 90's-00's.

## Re-readings 
In order to explore and re-tell our dedicated text House of Leaves, our group; Wen, Yutang, Faye, Peem and myself have decided to leap into the unknown Minecraft. Our [*machinima*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinima) themed project is to communicate a chapter from the horror and romance novel within a child dominated platform. The 8-bit inspired game is ruled by physics while having infitnite possibilities (all of which we have no idea how to use, this'll be the groups first time exeriencing this world).
