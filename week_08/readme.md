# Objectified 

## Week 08

Today was a chance to share our paper prototypes in small groups to help develop our code and recieve feedback from our peers. Andy reinforced that our code is to focus on the text using only typography and code! 

Feedback:
- Have the words dissolve/ fade instead of click away 
- Look into perlin noise
- Typography is fundamental
- Keep creating and making many solutions to the problem 

Andy also shared with us some previous projects he and Karen had worked on in the past. The practice of [*Datamoshing*](http://datamoshing.com): "the process of manipulating the data of media files in order to achieve visual or auditory effects when the file is decoded." 

A key example of where datamoshing became mainstream - and unfortunately not worth pursuing... 
I present you: Kanye.

## Coding with Karen

A sketch to learn about "class" contruction 

[*Stack Over Flow Definition*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3686647/whats-the-best-way-to-define-the-words-class-and-object-to-someone-who-hasn) 
"A class is kind of the blueprint or template that describes the methods and variables that will be in each object. An object is an instantiated (instance of a) class; an object is something, while the class is simply the plans to make that something."
