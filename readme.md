Karen and Andy opened the semester with a request to think about a few very simple questions: 

1.	*What was the most recent book of which you interacted?*
2.	*What was the most recent long-form text that you read?*
3.	*Where do you find your news information?*

Admittedly, I wasn’t entirely aware of their importance initially; taking them to be a question—quite literally—of how we consume media. However, the importance of these questions became more and more evident as the semester continued. It is undeniable to say that the way that we consume information is continually evolving and changing. How we interpret text—and relay information—will continue to change and grow to fit the modes in which it is presented. At least *prima facie*, it appears that we all want to access our information succinctly, and in the most accessible possible form (so, I’ll try to be brief!).

Reading used to incorporate the simple processes of opening the right page, starting in the right place, and looking at a sequence of characters printed in the right order. This subject has taught me that a mere translation of this process to the digital realm is to misspend its capability. Through Processing, we were able to explore and create “reading machines”, and begin to recognise the potential that is available through their use. The incorporation of sound, touch, and camera-monitored movements heightened user interaction with traditional media in a way in which I did not think possible only months ago. Through dedication and experimentation, my peers and I have certainly *positively* recreated my beliefs about reading and interpreting code! 

Andy and Karen guided our class through several practices; including electronic literature, machinima, pseudo-code, datamoshing, and so on, and unveiled to me so many new concepts that I had yet experienced (or yet imagined). This subject opened up new questions concerning media more generally, about whether there is still impetus to create typography by hand, or whether it is dominated solely by generative design algorithms instead. Despite designers looking to digitally create typefaces—and move away from their hand-drawn counterparts—this subject has restated the importance of creation in our industry: it is not enough to transcribe, to relay, or to “let the computer do the work”, but find new ways to ensure that thoughtful and provoking illustration and design remains at the forefront of our collective endeavour. By doing so, it has been shown that a brand-new perspective of the text is revealed, and with it, new understandings and opinions of our culture and society.
