# Introduction 
## Week 01

In today's age, our concentration is limited and we are easily distracted - we want our information quick, concise and in bullet points before commiting to giving our precious time to an article, lest a book. <br>

Opening the Semester, Andy and Karen introduced us to what we'd be covering over the next 13 or so weeks. Our first task will be covering a chapter of *House of Leaves* by Mark Z. Danielewski. In groups, we will perform an extract in a digital world.


*What was the most recent book you interacted with?* <br>
*What was the most recent long-form text you read?*<br>
*Where do you get your news/info?*<br>

The class explored a digital representation of Melbourne's CBD in Minecraft Education Education.

My initials [*'B'*](https://bridieotoole.github.io/codewords/week_01/B/) and [*'O'*](https://bridieotoole.github.io/codewords/week_01/Owithdots/).

Our homework for the week was to create our initials on a 500x500 pixel canvas. I chose to create blocky, capital letters which change colour based on curser location.

I did some research for the background because I wanted something which was interactive and colourful but not overwhelming... Iâ€™m not sure if I've mastered the art of the most aesthetic coded characters, but I've enjoyed playing around with colours, shapes, outlines and size.

```
let max_distance;

function setup() {
createCanvas (500,500);
background (235,210,200); //R,G,B
max_distance = dist(0,0,width,height);
}


function draw() {
  background (mouseX/2,(mouseY+mouseX)/4,mouseY/2); 

for (let i = 0; i <= width; i+= 50) {
  for (let j = 0; j <= height; j+= 50) {
    let size = dist(mouseX, mouseY, i, j);
    size = (size / max_distance) * 70; 
    ellipse(i, j, size, size);
  }
 }
fill (mouseY/2,(mouseX+mouseY/2),mouseX)/2;
strokeWeight (3);
stroke (mouseX/2,(mouseY+mouseX/2),mouseY/2);
ellipse (250,175,200,200);
ellipse (250,325,200,200);
rect (150,75,95,350);
noStroke ();
ellipse (244,250,143,347);
}
```
