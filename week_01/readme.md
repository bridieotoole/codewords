# Introduction 
## Week 1

My initials [*'B'*](https://bridieotoole.github.io/codewords/week_01/B/) and [*'O'*](https://bridieotoole.github.io/codewords/week_01/Owithdots/).

Our homework for the week was to create our initials on a 500x500 pixel canvas. I chose to create blocky, capital letters which change colour based on curser location.

I did some research for the background because I wanted something which was interactive and colourful but not overwhelming... Iâ€™m not sure if I've mastered the art of the most aesthetic coded characters, but I've enjoyed playing around with colours, shapes, outlines and size.
