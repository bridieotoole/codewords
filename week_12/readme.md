# Lost In Time

## Week 12

Here's what we've all been waiting for... [*The Major: Lost In Time*](https://bridieotoole.github.io/codewords/week_12/LostInTime/)

Lost In Time is an interpretative visual of an extract ‘Cyberpsycogeography’ by Mark Amerika. America explores how the creative potential is unlocked and experienced in a dream-like state called ‘unreal time’. America continuously loses himself in new personas, distributed in the field he operates, regardless of physical location.

Amerika impresses the importance of positioning himself to move beyond the contemporary—though the declaration ‘as if such a thing as Time could actually exist’, poses the question if his former statement is even possible in his mind. He resolves, that consciousness can be achieved anywhere at anytime.

To embody the etherial essence of losing sense of time, a rendition of the timeless second movement ‘Air on the G String’ by J.S Bach is paired for its suspension-in-time melancholy melody to slow the reader in order to absorb the reflective memoir.

Through iterative design choices, I played with the concept of being submerged underwater. The weightlessness forced upon all objects once below is the closest sensation we can experience to the stopping of time. I’ve chosen a murky pale blue background for the ‘white-wash’ text to float beneath and drift away from view.
